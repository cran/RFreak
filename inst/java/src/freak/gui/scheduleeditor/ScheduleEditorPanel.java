/**
 * An abstract JPanel for use in the <code>ScheduleEditor</code>. It contains links to useful classes that nearly every Panel will need. The <code>ScheduleEditor</code> communicates with <code>ScheduleEditorPanels</code> the following way: - to display a panel, it calls the <code>enter()</code> method which calls <code>initForStartedSchedule()</code> if the schedule did already start. This method should disable the components that are not meant to be changed after the schedule started. - to change panels, it asks if it is ok to leave the current panel by issuing <code>mayLeave()</code>. This method should warn the user and return <code>false</code> if needed configuration steps aren't done yet. Then the new panel is created and shown via <code>enter()</code>. If the new panel is a successor of this panel, <code>mayAdvance()</code> is called to see if it is syntactically correct to change to a later panel.
